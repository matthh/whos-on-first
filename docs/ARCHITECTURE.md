# Who's On First — Architecture

**Last reviewed: 2026-06-16**

## Purpose

Who's On First is a single-user-per-coach web app that generates defensive position assignments for youth baseball / softball games. A coach manages a roster of 10–13 players, marks absent players before each game, and clicks Generate to produce a per-inning lineup that satisfies a configurable constraint set (positional restrictions, fairness rules, outfield rotations, etc.). The sheet is exportable as a PDF. An optional Spotify integration auto-builds a walk-on-music playlist in batting order.

## Data ownership

All data lives in Neon Postgres. There is no external blob store.

| Table | Owns |
|---|---|
| `users` | Coach accounts: Google auth identity, Spotify per-coach OAuth tokens (legacy path), role, status |
| `teams` | One user → many teams. Stores constraint config JSON, logo data URL, cached Spotify playlist id, walk-on playlist URL |
| `rosters` | `players` JSON array keyed by `(userId, teamId)` — player names, ranks, absent flags, walk-on songs, avoid-positions |
| `game_history` | Snapshot of players + ranks per game date, keyed by `(userId, teamId)` |
| `app_settings` | App-owner Spotify service account tokens (key-value store, single row per setting) |
| `constraint_overrides` | Per-team per-constraint boolean overrides (currently unused in routing — config is stored in `teams.constraintConfig`) |

**Note:** `users.teamName`, `users.logoDataUrl`, `users.constraintConfig` are legacy columns — all new writes go to `teams`. Old rows read gracefully.

## Authentication & Sessions

1. `/api/auth/google-login` → redirects to Google OAuth with HMAC-signed state + nonce cookie.
2. `/api/auth/google-login-callback` → verifies state (HMAC + nonce + expiry), fetches Google profile, finds-or-creates user, sets HMAC session cookie (`wof-session`).
3. Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) validates the session cookie on every request (except `PUBLIC_PATHS`). On success it sets `x-user-id` request header; all API routes read auth identity from this header via `getUserId()` / `getUser()` in `lib/auth.ts`.
4. Clients can never inject `x-user-id` — middleware strips it before forwarding.
5. New users are created with `status: "pending"`. An admin must approve them before the app is usable (pending users see a gate screen).
6. Session expiry: 30 days. No server-side revocation store — logout just clears the cookie.

**Admin action links** (`/api/admin/users/action?token=…`) are HMAC-signed and publicly accessible so admins can approve/reject from email without being logged in. Tokens expire after 7 days.

## Data flow — game sheet generation

All scheduling logic runs **client-side** in the browser:

```
page.tsx (handleGenerate)
  → generateGameSheet(players, config)         [lib/scheduler.ts]
      → buildBench(...)                         picks bench assignments
      → computeOFBlocked(...)                   marks OF-ineligible innings
      → solveAll(inn)                           recursive backtracker per inning
          → solveInning(...)                    generator yielding assignments
  → applyAvoidPositionsPostPass(sheet, ...)    soft prefer-position swaps
  → validateGameSheet(sheet, ...)              returns violation strings
  → POST /api/history                          persists snapshot to DB
  → POST /api/spotify/sync-playlist            fire-and-forget playlist sync
```

The solver uses hardcoded bench schedules for the standard 6-inning / 10-field-size case and a dynamic generator for non-standard configurations. A 10-second wall-clock budget prevents browser hangs on infeasible constraints.

**Playoff mode** (`config.playoffMode`) selects alternate bench schedules (`BENCH_6INN_PLAYOFF`) for 11- and 12-player rosters that: (1) keep all top-6 ranked players off the bench in the final inning, and (2) stagger top-6 sits so no two adjacent ranks sit together. 13-player teams already satisfy both rules with the default schedule.

## API endpoint reference

## Deprecated paths

- `lib/storage.ts` — `loadRoster` / `saveRoster` (localStorage) are no longer called from production code. `addHistoryEntry` and `clearAbsences` are still used as pure logic helpers in `page.tsx` but do not touch localStorage. Can be refactored to remove the localStorage code paths.
- `lib/constraints.ts` — `loadConstraints()` / `saveConstraints()` are marked `@deprecated` — replaced by `loadConfig()` / `saveConfig()`. These still touch localStorage and are not called from production code.
- `users.teamName`, `users.logoDataUrl`, `users.constraintConfig` — legacy schema columns, kept for row-read compatibility. New writes go to `teams`.
- Per-coach Spotify OAuth (`/api/auth/spotify-connect`, `/api/auth/spotify-callback`) — superseded by the service-account flow. The `users` table still has `spotifyAccessToken` / `spotifyRefreshToken` columns from this era. These columns are written to by the callback but the sync route no longer reads them (uses service account instead).
- `constraint_overrides` table — present in schema, migrated, but not read by any route or UI component.

## Tech debt

1. **`logoDataUrl` has no size limit** in the roster `PUT` route — a large base64 image can be stored without bounds.
2. **`constraint_overrides` table** exists in schema and migrations but is completely unused. Dead code at the DB layer.
3. **`storage.ts` is stale** — `loadRoster` / `saveRoster` check `typeof window` for SSR safety but the module is still imported in lib context. Recommend pruning or converting to pure utility functions.
4. **`practice-pdf.ts` duplicates `loadPennant`** — it has its own local copy of the function with its own cache, instead of importing the exported version from `pdf.ts`.
5. **No rate limiting** on `/api/spotify/sync-playlist` or `/api/practice/generate-station` — both make expensive third-party calls (Spotify API, Anthropic) without any throttling.
6. **Admin PATCH does not validate the `email` field** on update — the POST endpoint validates email format, but the PATCH path skips that check when changing an existing user's email.
7. **`Onboarding.tsx` uses fragile player ID generation** — `handleAddPlayer` in `src/components/Onboarding.tsx` still uses `parseInt(p.id)` / `String(maxId + 1)`. The matching issue was fixed in `page.tsx` (now uses `crypto.randomUUID()`) but `Onboarding.tsx` was missed. Non-numeric IDs would produce NaN.
8. **XSS in admin action page** — `src/app/api/admin/users/action/route.ts` interpolates `user.name || user.email` directly into an HTML response without escaping. A user who signs up with a crafted name can inject script tags into the admin approval page.

*Items resolved in previous audits: H1 (admin Spotify token leak), H2 (history POST validation), M1 (scheduler console.log), M4 (page.tsx UUID), L1 (admin email env var), L3 (drizzle-kit devDependencies).*

## Gotchas

- **Session cookie vs. OAuth state**: the Spotify per-coach callback is in `PUBLIC_PATHS` (required for redirect flows), but the state token embeds the userId — so the callback can still associate tokens without relying on the session cookie being present.
- **Edge runtime in middleware**: `validateToken` reimplements the HMAC check using `crypto.subtle` (Web Crypto) because `crypto.timingSafeEqual` from Node.js is unavailable in the Vercel Edge runtime. The two implementations must stay in sync.
- **`getActiveTeam` has a side effect**: if a user has teams but no `activeTeamId`, it picks the oldest team and writes `activeTeamId` back to the DB. Callers should be aware this is not a pure read.
- **Solver runs client-side**: the backtracking scheduler runs in the browser, not on the server. This keeps the API surface simple but means mobile browsers may time out on edge-case constraint configurations.
- **Admin email env var**: `lib/email.ts` reads `ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`, falling back to `matthh@gmail.com`. The env var is optional but recommended to avoid leaking a personal address in source.
